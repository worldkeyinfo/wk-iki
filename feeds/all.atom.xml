that you can learn more about WorldKey, it's technologies, and see the system
in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="videos"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="epcot-center-s-worldkey-information-system-documentary-1984"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqMwKtpsWb4"&gt;EPCOT Center's WorldKey Information System Documentary (1984)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an official documentary published by the Walt Disney Company.
It explains some information introducing the system, and the basic technologies
behind the WorldKey system (loosely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="worldkey-information-at-epcot-center"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM2lgMitoVY"&gt;WorldKey Information at EPCOT Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contains a video shot by MartinsVidsDotNet containing a screen recording
of the use of the system, along with some information about how it worked and the
failings of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, this explains WorldKey's functionality, and includes some screen recording
with the 'Bit' character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="world-key-information-service-screen-view-1991"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="_ScreenView1991_"&gt;World Key Information Service Screen View 1991&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a screen recording of the WorldKey system from 1991, including
a recording of the audio from the WorldKey system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="epcot-center-worldkey-information-service"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="_ScreenView1990_"&gt;EPCOT Center WorldKey Information Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a screen recording of WorldKey from 1990. It explains the WorldKey functionality
and shows some of the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="worldkey-information-systems"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="_BeforeBit_"&gt;Worldkey Information Systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the pre-Bit explaination of WorldKey, possibly source quality from the initial version of the WorldKey system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The WorldKey Information Service was a touch-screen based information system located
at EPCOT Center between it's opening in 1982, until closure on March 21st 1999. It allowed users to
view the maps, and location information of EPCOT's attractions, and also allowed for 2-way
video communication between the user and a cast member, by way of two video cameras (a black and
white video camera for the user, and a colour video camera for the cast member).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982, the host appeared to be generic human, but by around 1984 (estimate) the host was replaced with
a character called 'Bit'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information was displayed in a hierarchial format, in a tree like structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Future World kiosks were initially located within the Space Ship Earth (SSE) postshow, but these were later relocated to outside
Guest Relations (where they remained until closure). Several were also located around the World Showcase. In total, there were 29 terminals
at 5 locations around the park.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;WorldKey was designed to be very user friendly and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating on the fly video and audio wasn't feasible at the time, so an alternative was needed.
That's where 'Video Disc' or 'LaserDisc' came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the laserdisc player used was the Sony LDP-1000(a), which allowed for programming using
the RS232-C protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content on this disc however wasn't easily updatable (it would require an entirely new disc be created, which
is expensive considering one disc per player would be needed). That's why an overlay feature was implemented to overlay text
onto the laserdisc video.&lt;/p&gt;
