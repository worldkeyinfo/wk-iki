:summary: Overview of the WorldKey Information Service system

The WorldKey Information Service was a touch-screen based information system located
at EPCOT Center between it's opening in 1982, until closure on March 21st 1999. It allowed users to
view the maps, and location information of EPCOT's attractions, and also allowed for 2-way
video communication between the user and a cast member, by way of two video cameras (a black and
white video camera for the user, and a colour video camera for the cast member).

In 1982, the host appeared to be generic human, but by around 1984 (estimate) the host was replaced with
a character called 'Bit'.

The information was displayed in a hierarchial format, in a tree like structure.

The Future World kiosks were initially located within the Space Ship Earth (SSE) postshow, but these were later relocated to outside
Guest Relations (where they remained until closure). Several were also located around the World Showcase. In total, there were 29 terminals
at 5 locations around the park.
