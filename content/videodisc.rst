:summary: Information about the videodisc functionality of WorldKey

WorldKey was designed to be very user friendly and simple.

Generating on the fly video and audio wasn't feasible at the time, so an alternative was needed.
That's where 'Video Disc' or 'LaserDisc' came in.

Initially, the laserdisc player used was the Sony LDP-1000(a), which allowed for programming using
the RS232-C protocol.

The content on this disc however wasn't easily updatable (it would require an entirely new disc be created, which
is expensive considering one disc per player would be needed). That's why an overlay feature was implemented to overlay text
onto the laserdisc video.
